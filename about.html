				<h2>A Brief History About Me</h2>
				<p>
					A young, unmarried professional launching his career in games design.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a person I am engaging and fun with a good sense of humour and this is illustrated in my daily work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently studying at Northampton University in my first year of BSc Games Development, working hard and achieving good grades.	
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously I attended a two year course at Milton Keynes college studying Games Design which gave me a good overall grounding in the subject that I wish to excel at.	
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a hard worker and am self-motivated. I work well in a team and individually. A natural leader when appropriate and a supportive mainstay when necessary. I am gregarious, patient and calm.
					I am not easily stressed or upset and take life as it comes but I strive to achieve and be the best in all that I do.	
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a general IT specialist and can work my way strategically through problems to find the best solution, I have a logical but innovative mind. 
					I am keen to explore and utilise new technologies but in the future I would like to be responsible for the development of new innovations particularly in the area of gaming.					
				</p>
				<p>
					I am particularly interested in leading a team within a smaller organisation where I can be involved in all areas of games development from the artwork through to the coding, marketing and distribution.	
				</p>
				<p>
					In am keen to feel the ownership of the product I develop and produce which is sometimes lost in larger organisations.	
				</p>
				<p>	
				I am a keen bmx rider which keeps me fit and healthy and semi-professional COD player which sees me travelling the country and the world to play in competitions.
				I am a keen social media user and have a big network of friends and colleagues around the world which I call on for professional input and friendship.
