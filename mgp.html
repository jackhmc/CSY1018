				<h2>MGP</h2>
				<p>
					When designing this website, I had many ideas of the aesthetics that I wanted. 
					I wanted the website to look modern and sleek, the two pictures above were the websites which stood out the most to me. 
					Not just because of the appearance but because of the simplicity and navigation of the page.
					The common aspect of both websites was the full image background which I decided to implement into my website, I used it on all pages because it looks modern and aesthetically pleasing.
					To add to that, the image I used linked to the websites purpose.
				<p>
					Both of the websites both had a sleep and simple navigation at the top of the page.
					The difference with mine is that I used buttons that were seperated from eachother with a shadow as it is easier to see and more visible when they are highlighted.
					They had borders which I liked but i prefered the full image background and wanted it to be used as much as possible.
					The thing I wish I created and implemented into my website was a clean logo that I could use as my personal brand. It would help it look more proffessional and appealing.
				</p>
				<p>
					I added a border where the information was which I thought get the website an extra level of user comfortability as it makes everything organised.
					The colour pallete I used was very simple and bland but looked clean and they suited well. I also kept my content centred which is easier to read and looks neater on the page.
